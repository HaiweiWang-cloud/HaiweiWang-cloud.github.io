            <p>Hi I am Haiwei. I am a student studying physics. This is my website where I share my blog for things that interest me. I have a special section called "The Physics Playground" where I keep notes and cool projects related to physics.

                Everything here is still work in progress. I am just discovering the power of web development tools. There are so many things that we can do with it! So you will expect this site to change appearance many times, don't be startled!
