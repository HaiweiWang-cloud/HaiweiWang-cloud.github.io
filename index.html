            <p>Hi I am Haiwei. I am a student studying physics. This is my website where I share my blog for things that interest me. I have a special section called "The Physics Playground" where I keep notes and cool projects related to physics.

                Everything here is still work in progress. I am just discovering the power of web development tools. There are so many things that we can do with it! So you will expect this site to change appearance many times, don't be startled!

                <p>I built a simple audio amplifier on a breadboard with a single stage common-emitter amplifier! I can't believe it worked first time! Now I finally have a speaker for my PC.</p>
                <p>This design is not the best. For one, it draws power even with no audio input, the sound quality is acceptable but quite noisy, and it could do with more volume and maybe a volume control knob.</p>
                <p>This is only the most basic type of amplifier, and knowing that it works, I will make continuous incremental improvements to get a sick home audio system. This project will be documented in a post coming soon!</p>

                    <p> I learnt flexbox in CSS using a game called <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">flexbox froggy</a>, pretty cool! I need to remember this when I inevitably forget how to use flexbox.</p>
